# 🖥️ How to Create a Virtual Machine (VM)

Creating VMs is a fundamental DevOps task—whether for on-premise environments or in the cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP). DevOps engineers focus on **automation, scalability, and efficiency** when provisioning infrastructure.

## 🔧 Manual vs Automated VM Creation

**Scenario:**  
- Customer A needs 100 VMs  
- Customer B needs another 100 VMs  

Doing this **manually** through UI or shell scripts could take **100+ hours**.

> 🚀 A DevOps engineer uses **automation scripts** to dynamically spin up VMs with minimal effort, ensuring efficiency, consistency, and scalability.

## ✅ What DevOps Engineers Automate for VM Provisioning

1. **Validation** – Ensure correct inputs (e.g., VM size, region, image, networking)
2. **Authentication** – Secure access to cloud services (e.g., IAM, service principals)
3. **Authorization** – Define who is allowed to provision what resources
4. **Provisioning Logic** – Loops, conditions, dependencies, and retries

## ⚙️ 5 Ways to Automate VM Creation

| Method       | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **1. CLI**   | Command-line interfaces like `aws ec2 run-instances`, `az vm create` |
| **2. API**   | Call cloud provider REST APIs using tools like `curl`, `Postman`, or SDKs |
| **3. CFT**   | AWS CloudFormation Templates – Declarative YAML/JSON-based infra setup |
| **4. Terraform** | HashiCorp tool for cross-cloud infrastructure provisioning as code |
| **5. CDK**   | AWS Cloud Development Kit – Define infrastructure using familiar programming languages (TypeScript, Python, etc.) |

## 🧠 Summary

> DevOps engineers use **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tools and scripts to automate VM creation across environments. This ensures repeatability, auditability, and speed, especially when provisioning **hundreds or thousands of VMs**.
