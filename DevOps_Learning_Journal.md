### 1. What is DevOps?
DevOps is a **culture and set of practices** aimed at improving software delivery by combining software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).
It emphasizes:
- Continuous integration & deployment (CI/CD)
- Automation
- Monitoring
- Testing
- Collaboration

### 2. Why DevOps?
Common challenges DevOps solves:
- Slow, manual deployments
- Lack of automation
- Poor collaboration
- Bugs in production

**Benefits:**
- Faster time to market  
- Continuous delivery  
- Improved system stability  
- Automated pipelines and scalable infrastructure  

### 3. What Do DevOps Engineers Do?
- Design and maintain **CI/CD pipelines**
- Automate infrastructure with **Terraform** or **CloudFormation**
- Implement monitoring tools like **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **ELK**
- Write scripts in **Bash**, **Python**
- Manage version control with **Git**
- Collaborate with development, QA, and operations

### 4. SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
SDLC is the process of building and maintaining software through phases:

| Phase        | Description                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| Planning     | Understand requirements              |
| Designing    | System architecture (HLD, LLD)       |
| Development  | Writing and committing code          |
| Testing      | QA, automation, performance testing  |
| Deployment   | Releasing to production              |
| Maintenance  | Post-deployment support              |

> DevOps focuses on **automating** and **accelerating** the Build → Test → Deploy phases.

**Detailed Flow:**

- **Building**: Local development → Pushed to Git repo
- **Testing**: Code moves to server → QA tests
- **Deployment**: Promoted to production → Delivered to customer

### 5. Core Infrastructure Concepts

#### ✅ What is a Virtual Machine (VM)?
A **VM** is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It runs an operating system and applications just like a physical computer.
- Can run multiple VMs on a single physical host
- Each VM is isolated from others

#### ✅ What is a Server?
A **server** is a computer (physical or virtual) that provides services or resources to other computers, typically over a network.
- Can be physical (bare metal) or virtual (VM)
- Used in web hosting, databases, file sharing, etc.

#### ✅ Physical vs Virtual Servers
| Feature | Physical Server | Virtual Server (VM) |
|--------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Setup | Dedicated hardware | Hosted on physical machine |
| Cost | Higher | Lower |
| Flexibility | Fixed resources | Easy to scale |
| Isolation | One system | Multiple VMs share hardware |

#### ✅ What is a Hypervisor?
A **hypervisor** is software that allows multiple VMs to run on a single physical machine by abstracting and managing hardware resources.
- Type 1: Bare-metal (e.g., VMware ESXi)
- Type 2: Hosted (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware Workstation)

#### ✅ What is Logical Isolation?
Logical isolation means that each VM or container operates in its **own environment**, even though they share the same physical hardware.
- Prevents interference between applications
- Increases security and resource efficiency

### 6. DevOps Efficiency vs Inefficiency

#### ✅ Efficiency
- Automated build, test, deploy pipelines
- Infrastructure as Code
- Monitoring and logging
- Continuous feedback and delivery
- Collaboration between teams

#### ❌ Inefficiency
- Manual deployments and testing
- Lack of version control or CI/CD
- Poor documentation
- Siloed communication
- Unmonitored infrastructure

> DevOps aims to **eliminate inefficiencies** through automation, integration, and real-time feedback.
