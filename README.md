# 🚀 DevOps Learning Journal

## 📖 Overview
Welcome to my **DevOps Learning Journal**!

This repository is a structured record of my journey as I learn and apply DevOps practices. It includes:
- Conceptual notes 🧠
- Architecture diagrams 🖼️
- Practical exercises and scripts ⚙️

Topics covered range from **CI/CD pipelines**, **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**, to **infrastructure automation**, **monitoring**, and more.

This is a personal learning journal to track and showcase my daily progress while learning **DevOps**. It includes notes, diagrams, and practice projects covering key DevOps concepts like CI/CD, SDLC, automation, monitoring, and infrastructure as code.
